But here’s the issue: **Peacock isn’t available everywhere**. Due to regional restrictions, many international viewers are **blocked** from accessing the full catalog. In this guide, we’ll explain why these blocks exist and how **[9Proxy](https://the9proxy.short.gy/home-github-james2k4)** lets you unlock Peacock from **anywhere in the world**.

## Why Peacock Limits Access Based on Location

Peacock restricts content based on:

- 🧾 **Content licensing agreements**
- 🌍 **Regional broadcasting rights**
- 🎥 **Distribution laws specific to each country**

As a result, most shows and movies are **only viewable in the U.S.**. If you’re trying to access Peacock from abroad, you’ll likely receive error messages or see a **reduced catalog**—or be blocked entirely.

This geo-blocking system is frustrating for anyone wanting the full **Peacock streaming experience**.

## How to Access Peacock Without Geographic Restrictions

The best way to unlock Peacock’s full library is by using a **proxy or VPN** that gives you a **U.S.-based IP address**. This tricks Peacock into thinking you're in the U.S., thereby **removing all regional blocks**.

### Why Residential Proxies Work Best

**Residential proxies** use real IPs from real devices, which makes them:

- ✅ Much harder to detect or blacklist
- ✅ More stable and consistent for long streaming sessions
- ✅ Ideal for services like Peacock, which monitor traffic closely

That’s why I recommend **[9Proxy](https://the9proxy.short.gy/home-github-james2k4)**—a premium residential proxy provider designed for high-performance streaming.
